# Story 1.3: Core UI Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to define my data schema, write a prompt, configure a webhook, and trigger an extraction,
**so that** I can submit a data extraction job.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI allows me to add and name fields for a data schema.
2. The UI provides a text area for my natural language prompt.
3. The UI has an input field for my webhook URL.
4. Clicking the "Extract Data" button sends the page URL, schema, prompt, and webhook to the backend API.
5. The UI displays a "Processing..." status message after submitting the job.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.2, the backend API endpoint is now available at POST /api/extract:
- Accepts ExtractRequest payload with pageUrl, webhookUrl, schema, prompt
- Returns ExtractResponse with jobId and 202 Accepted status
- Includes proper CORS headers for Chrome extension communication
- Validates URL formats and required fields

### Data Models
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#4.2]
The UI must construct and send this request format:

**ExtractRequest (Frontend to Backend):**
```typescript
interface ExtractRequest {
  pageUrl: string;
  webhookUrl: string;
  schema: Record<string, any>; // JSON schema defined by the user
  prompt: string;
}
```

**ExtractResponse (Backend to Frontend):**
```typescript
interface ExtractResponse {
  jobId: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18.x for building dynamic UIs
- **UI Component Library:** Shadcn/UI (Latest) for modern, accessible components
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.x for utility-first CSS framework
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x for type safety

### File Locations
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#5]
- Main component: `apps/extension/src/App.tsx`
- Reusable components: `apps/extension/src/components/`
- API service: `apps/extension/src/services/`
- Custom hooks: `apps/extension/src/hooks/`
- Shared types: `packages/types/src/index.ts`

### API Integration Details
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#4.1]
- **Endpoint:** POST /api/extract
- **Content-Type:** application/json
- **Expected Status:** 202 Accepted
- **Error Handling:** 400 Bad Request for validation errors

### Chrome Extension APIs
The UI needs to:
- Get current tab URL using chrome.tabs.query API
- Handle Chrome extension popup/side panel lifecycle
- Manage extension storage for configuration persistence (for future story)

### UI Design Goals
[Source: docs/Visual Data Extractor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD).md#3]
- **Single-Purpose Interface:** Dedicated to defining and executing one extraction job
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple by default with optional advanced schema builder
- **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate feedback when extraction job is initiated
- **Clean and Fast:** "Get in, get data, get out" experience

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- Must work within Chrome extension content security policy
- TypeScript 5.x for type safety
- React 18.x component patterns
- Tailwind CSS 3.x utility classes only

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Frontend Testing Framework:** Vitest (Latest)
- Test files colocated with components: `*.test.ts` files
- Must test component rendering, user interactions, and API integration
- Mock Chrome extension APIs for testing
