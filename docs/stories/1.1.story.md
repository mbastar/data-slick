# Story 1.1: Foundational Project Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a complete monorepo setup for the Chrome extension and backend service,
**so that** I have a functional development environment to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized with a package manager (e.g., npm workspaces, pnpm).
2. A basic Chrome extension project is created with a manifest file and a placeholder UI.
3. A basic serverless function project is created for the backend API.
4. The developer can run the frontend and backend services locally.

  - [x] Create root package.json with pnpm workspace configuration
  - [x] Create pnpm-workspace.yaml file
  - [x] Set up .gitignore with proper exclusions
- [x] Create Chrome extension project structure (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create apps/extension directory structure
  - [x] Create manifest.json with required Chrome extension configuration
  - [x] Set up React TypeScript project with necessary dependencies
  - [x] Create placeholder UI components
  - [x] Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI
  - [x] Set up tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create backend API project structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create apps/api directory
  - [x] Create extract.py serverless function file
  - [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary Python dependencies
  - [x] Set up basic endpoint structure for POST /api/extract
- [x] Create shared packages structure (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create packages/types directory
  - [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for ExtractRequest, ExtractResponse, WebhookPayload
  - [x] Set up package.json for types package
- [x] Configure local development environment (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add development scripts to root package.json
  - [x] Ensure Chrome extension can be loaded in developer mode
  - [x] Set up Vercel CLI for local serverless function testing
  - [x] Create README with setup and run instructions

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-api-specification-data-models.md#4.2]
The types package should export these TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface ExtractRequest {
  pageUrl: string;
  webhookUrl: string;
  schema: Record<string, any>; // JSON schema defined by the user
  prompt: string;
}

interface ExtractResponse {
  jobId: string;
}

interface WebhookPayload {
  success: boolean;
  sourceUrl: string;
  data: Record<string, any> | null; // The structured data from Firecrawl
  error?: string; // Included if success is false
  jobId: string;
}
```

### Development Environment Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.2]
- **Platform**: Vercel for seamless frontend + serverless backend deployment
- **Local Development**: Chrome for extension testing, Vercel CLI for API testing
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient monorepo management

### Testing Configuration
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest (Latest) - Modern, fast testing framework
- **Backend Testing**: pytest (Latest) - Industry standard for Python testing
