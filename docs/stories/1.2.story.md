# Story 1.2: Backend Extraction Endpoint Stub

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a backend API endpoint that accepts extraction requests from the Chrome extension,
**so that** the frontend has a target to communicate with.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A serverless function is created that accepts a POST request with a URL, schema, and prompt.
2. The endpoint validates the incoming request payload.
3. The endpoint returns a mock Job ID and a 202 Accepted status code.
4. The endpoint is deployed and accessible via a secure URL.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create serverless function endpoint structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update apps/api/extract.py to handle POST requests
  - [x] Define request handler function for /api/extract endpoint
  - [x] Set up proper HTTP method routing for POST requests
- [x] Implement request payload validation (AC: 2)
  - [x] Import and use ExtractRequest type from packages/types
  - [x] Validate required fields: pageUrl, webhookUrl, schema, prompt
  - [x] Add proper error responses for invalid payloads (400 Bad Request)
  - [x] Validate URL formats for pageUrl and webhookUrl
- [x] Create mock response logic (AC: 3)
  - [x] Generate mock Job ID using uuid or similar
  - [x] Return ExtractResponse with jobId field
  - [x] Set proper HTTP status code 202 Accepted
  - [x] Add appropriate response headers (Content-Type: application/json)
- [x] Configure deployment and accessibility (AC: 4)
  - [x] Ensure Vercel deployment configuration is correct
  - [x] Test endpoint accessibility via HTTPS
  - [x] Verify CORS headers are properly configured for Chrome extension
- [x] Add comprehensive testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Create test_extract.py with unit tests for the endpoint
  - [x] Test valid request handling and mock response generation
  - [x] Test invalid request validation and error responses
  - [x] Test CORS functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.1, the foundational project structure has been established with:
- pnpm monorepo with apps/api directory containing extract.py
- Basic Python serverless function file already exists
- Requirements.txt and package.json configuration in place
- Vercel deployment configuration established

### Data Models
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#4.2]
The endpoint must handle these TypeScript interfaces:

**ExtractRequest (Frontend to Backend):**
```typescript
interface ExtractRequest {
  pageUrl: string;
  webhookUrl: string;
  schema: Record<string, any>; // JSON schema defined by the user
  prompt: string;
}
```

**ExtractResponse (Backend to Frontend):**
```typescript
interface ExtractResponse {
  jobId: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#4.1]
- **Endpoint:** POST /api/extract
- **Description:** Initiates an asynchronous data extraction job
- **Authentication:** None for the MVP
- **Response Status:** 202 Accepted for successful requests
- **Content-Type:** application/json

### File Locations
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#5]
- Primary endpoint file: `apps/api/extract.py`
- Shared types: `packages/types/src/index.ts` (already created in story 1.1)
- Test file: `apps/api/test_extract.py`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Backend Language:** Python 3.9
- **API Framework:** Standard Python Serverless (Vercel native support)
- **Platform:** Vercel for deployment
- Must handle CORS for Chrome extension communication

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Backend Testing Framework:** pytest (Latest)
- Test files should be colocated with the code they test
- Follow standard naming conventions: `test_*.py` for backend
- Tests must cover both valid and invalid request scenarios
- Include CORS testing for Chrome extension compatibility

### Chrome Extension CORS Requirements
Since this API will be called from a Chrome extension, proper CORS headers are essential:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (or specific origins for production)
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with robust input validation, proper error handling, and comprehensive test coverage. The code follows Python best practices with clear separation of concerns and appropriate HTTP status code usage.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed. The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows the serverless function patterns correctly.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python best practices and PEP 8
- Project Structure: ✓ Files in correct locations per architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive pytest suite with 15 test cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] POST request handling with proper routing
- [x] Complete request payload validation
- [x] Mock response generation with realistic Job IDs
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes and headers
- [x] CORS configuration for Chrome extension
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Vercel deployment configuration
- [x] Complete test coverage

### Security Review

✓ **No security concerns** - proper input validation prevents malicious payloads, CORS headers are appropriately configured, and no sensitive information is exposed in error messages.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Optimized for serverless** - efficient request processing with minimal cold start impact, proper error responses prevent unnecessary processing.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

Robust API endpoint implementation that provides a solid foundation for the frontend integration. All acceptance criteria met with high-quality, production-ready code.
