# Story 1.4: Full Backend Extraction and Webhook Logic

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to process my extraction request and send the final data to my webhook,
**so that** I can receive the structured information I asked for.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The backend service, upon receiving a request, calls the Firecrawl /extract API.
2. The service correctly stores the returned Job ID.
3. The service implements a polling mechanism to check the job status.
4. When the job status is "completed," the service sends the data payload to the user's webhook URL.
5. If the job status is "failed," the service logs the error (no user-facing feedback for MVP).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Integrate Firecrawl SDK and initiate extraction job (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Install Firecrawl Python SDK package in requirements.txt
  - [x] Update extract.py to initialize Firecrawl client with API key from environment
  - [x] Replace mock job ID response with actual Firecrawl /extract API call
  - [x] Store the returned job ID for polling
  - [x] Handle Firecrawl API errors and return appropriate HTTP status
- [x] Implement job status polling mechanism (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create polling logic that checks job status every 2-3 seconds
  - [x] Use Firecrawl SDK to check job status via /extract/{job_id} endpoint
  - [x] Continue polling until status is "completed", "failed", or timeout (20 seconds)
  - [x] Handle rate limiting and network errors during polling
- [x] Extract and prepare final data payload (AC: 4)
  - [x] When job status is "completed", extract the structured data from response
  - [x] Construct WebhookPayload with success=true and extracted data
  - [x] Include source URL and job ID in the payload
- [x] Send data to user's webhook (AC: 4)
  - [x] Make HTTP POST request to user's webhook URL
  - [x] Set appropriate headers (Content-Type: application/json)
  - [x] Handle webhook delivery failures gracefully
  - [x] Log webhook response for debugging
- [x] Implement error handling and logging (AC: 5)
  - [x] When job status is "failed", log the error details
  - [x] Construct WebhookPayload with success=false and error message
  - [x] Send error payload to webhook for transparency
  - [x] Log all critical steps for debugging (job initiation, polling updates, final status)
- [x] Add timeout handling (Performance Requirement)
  - [x] Implement 20-second timeout for entire extraction process
  - [x] If timeout occurs, send timeout error to webhook
  - [x] Clean up resources on timeout
- [x] Add comprehensive testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Create unit tests for Firecrawl integration
  - [x] Test polling mechanism with various job states
  - [x] Test webhook delivery with mock endpoints
  - [x] Test error scenarios (API failures, timeouts, invalid webhooks)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.2, the backend endpoint stub is already created:
- Endpoint available at POST /api/extract
- Accepts ExtractRequest payload with pageUrl, webhookUrl, schema, prompt
- Currently returns mock job ID with 202 Accepted status
- Request validation is already implemented

From story 1.3, the frontend is now fully implemented and calling the API:
- Frontend sends properly formatted ExtractRequest to backend
- UI shows "Processing..." status after API call
- Frontend expects ExtractResponse with jobId

### Data Models
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#4.2]

**ExtractRequest (Already implemented in story 1.2):**
```python
# TypeScript interface for reference:
# interface ExtractRequest {
#   pageUrl: string;
#   webhookUrl: string;
#   schema: Record<string, any>; // JSON schema defined by the user
#   prompt: string;
# }
```

**WebhookPayload (Backend to User's Webhook):**
```python
# TypeScript interface for reference:
# interface WebhookPayload {
#   success: boolean;
#   sourceUrl: string;
#   data: Record<string, any> | null; // The structured data from Firecrawl
#   error?: string; // Included if success is false
#   jobId: string;
# }
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/Visual Data Extractor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD).md#2]
- **Firecrawl API:** Use /v1/extract endpoint to initiate job
- **Job Polling:** Use /v1/extract/{job_id} to check status
- **Expected States:** "processing", "completed", "failed"
- **Security:** Firecrawl API key must be stored as environment variable

### File Locations
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#5]
- Main serverless function: `apps/api/extract.py`
- Dependencies: `apps/api/requirements.txt`

### Technical Stack
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Backend Language:** Python 3.9
- **API Framework:** Standard Python Serverless (Vercel)
- **Third-Party Service:** Firecrawl.dev API v1

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/Visual Data Extractor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD).md#2]
- End-to-end extraction should complete in under 20 seconds
- Backend must efficiently handle polling without excessive delay

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/Visual Data Extractor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD).md#2]
- Firecrawl API key must never be exposed to client
- No user data should be stored permanently after job completion
- All data transmission must use HTTPS

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Backend Testing Framework:** pytest (Latest)
- Test files should test all edge cases including network failures
- Mock external services (Firecrawl API, webhook endpoints) for unit tests
