# Story 1.5: Local Configuration Persistence

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the extension to remember my last configuration,
**so that** I don't have to re-enter it every time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. After a successful extraction, the schema, prompt, and webhook URL are saved to chrome.storage.local.
2. When the extension is next opened, the UI fields are pre-populated with the saved data.
3. The user can modify the pre-populated data before running a new extraction.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Add loading state while retrieving stored configuration
- [x] Handle storage edge cases and user experience
  - [x] Handle first-time users with no stored configuration gracefully

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 1.3, the UI implementation is complete with:
- SchemaBuilder component for dynamic schema creation with state management
- Prompt textarea with character validation and state tracking
- Webhook URL input with format validation and state management
- Successful API integration that receives jobId from backend
- Complete form validation and error handling

From story 1.4, the backend integration is fully functional:
- API returns jobId upon successful request initiation
- Full extraction and webhook delivery pipeline working
- Success/failure states can trigger storage operations

### Data Models
**Configuration Storage Interface:**
```typescript
interface ConfigurationData {
  schema: Record<string, any>; // The user-defined schema fields
  prompt: string; // The natural language prompt
  webhookUrl: string; // The webhook destination URL
}
```

**Chrome Storage API Pattern:**
```typescript
// Save configuration
chrome.storage.local.set({ 'extractorConfig': configData });

// Load configuration  
chrome.storage.local.get(['extractorConfig'], (result) => {
  const config = result.extractorConfig;
});
```

### Chrome Extension Storage Specifications
[Source: apps/extension/public/manifest.json]
- **Permission:** "storage" permission already granted in manifest.json
- **API:** chrome.storage.local for persistent local storage
- **Scope:** Data persists across browser sessions but stays local to user's machine
- **Quota:** Chrome extension storage quota is typically 5MB for local storage

### File Locations
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#5]
- Storage service: `apps/extension/src/services/storage.ts`
- Main component: `apps/extension/src/App.tsx` (existing, needs modification)
- Service imports: `apps/extension/src/services/` (existing directory)

### Integration Points
[Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md Dev Notes]
The existing UI components that need persistence integration:
- **SchemaBuilder component:** Manages dynamic schema fields in React state
- **Prompt textarea:** Handles natural language input with validation
- **Webhook URL input:** Provides URL format validation
- **API service:** Already handles successful extraction response

### User Experience Requirements
[Source: docs/Visual Data Extractor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD).md#3]
- **Configuration Persistence:** Extension remembers last used schema, prompt, and webhook
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple by default with saved data pre-filled to streamline recurring use
- **Real-time Feedback:** Clear indication when saved configuration is loaded

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Trigger for Save:** After successful API call when jobId is received (not on form submission)  
- **Trigger for Load:** On extension popup/panel open (React component mount)
- **Data Validation:** Validate loaded data structure and clear if corrupted
- **User Control:** Users can modify any pre-populated field before submitting

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/Fullstack Architecture Document Visual Data Extractor.md#3]
- **Frontend Testing Framework:** Vitest (Latest)
- **Chrome API Mocking:** Mock chrome.storage.local for unit tests
- **Test Coverage:** All storage operations, edge cases, and UI integration points

### Security Considerations
- **Local Storage Only:** No sensitive data sent to external servers
- **User Control:** Users can clear stored data if desired
- **Data Validation:** Sanitize and validate all loaded configuration data
